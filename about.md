I am a graduate student in the Professional Master of Engineering in Robotics at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD. Expected to graduate in May 2018. My interests are in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning applied to intelligent systems, such as visual object recognition, classification or tracking. My present goal is to obtain a full-time job starting July 2018.
